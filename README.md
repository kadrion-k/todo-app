# To-Do List Web Application

A simple and interactive to-do list web application where users can add, mark, and remove tasks. The tasks are stored locally in the browser using localStorage, so they persist even after a page reload.


## Features

- Add tasks: Users can type a task in the input box and add it to the list by clicking the "Add" button or pressing the Enter key.
- Mark tasks as completed: Clicking on a task will strike it through, indicating it as completed.
- Remove tasks: Each task has a delete button (×) that allows users to remove the task from the list.
- Persistent tasks: Tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, so they remain even after refreshing the page.

## Technologies Used
- HTML: Structure of the to-do list application.
- CSS: Styling for a modern, user-friendly interface.
- JavaScript: Functionality for adding, removing, marking tasks, and saving tasks in local storage.
## How It Works
1. Add a Task:

 - Type your task in the input field and either click "Add" or press Enter.
 - The task is added to the list below.

2. Mark a Task as Completed:

 - Click on a task to mark it as completed. The task will have a strike-through effect.

3. Delete a Task:

4. Persist Data:
